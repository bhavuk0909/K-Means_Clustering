# K-Means_Clustering
The k-means clustering algorithm assigns data points to categories, or clusters, by finding the mean distance between data points. It then iterates through this technique in order to perform more accurate classifications over time. Since you must first start by classifying your data into k categories, it is essential that you understand your data well enough to do this.
